I've been writing a couple of things about MLOps, defining and refining my ideas about it. My blogposts are posted on [my medium](https://medium.com/@jeroen.franse). 

As I foresee that my ideas are going to develop, I'm planning to maintain these documents primarily from this git repository. 

At the moment, only one of my blogposts about MLOps is here, I might add the other later as well. The diagrams are jpg's, but I'd like to turn them into code so that they are easier to maintain as well.
